# BinanceAlerts

This tool allows you to set price alerts on Binance. It's a newer version of the Alert tool that I release long ago.

### Key Upgrades

- Simpler Interface.
- Desktop notifications.
- Runs in background.
- Auto-reconnect.
- Runs as a desktop application.

### Version2 Upgrades

- Visualize alerts.
- Realtime tick charts.

### How to run ?

Due to github file size constraint (100Mb), I could only upload the code. So run the following commands to build the .exe file from the code.

- Install Node JS [link](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `npm install`
- `electron-packager .`
